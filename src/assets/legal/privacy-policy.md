They are used to temporarily store information about the user's interaction with the website and keep it available for the duration of the session. Once the user leaves the website or closes their browser, session cookies are automatically deleted.

Session cookies contribute to the security of a website by, for example, ensuring that a user remains logged in while navigating through different pages or by preventing fraudulent activity.

The legal basis for this collection is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) GDPR (legitimate interest). We cannot offer you an opt-out of this collection, as it allows you to return to recently visited pages while remaining logged in.
